My first attempt at cloning a modern website template.

  - I'll be attempting this utilizing only vanilla JS, HTML, CSS to get a good feel for how to do things without libraries or frameworks.

  - I will be using none of the assets of the original website, but will try to match things as much as I can, so I'll likely use the same google fonts, or fo nt-awesome icons.

  - I will be heavily leaning on CSS Flexbox for positioning as opposed to the template which utilizes mostly bootstrap for a lot of that heavy lifting.
